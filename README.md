# RECRUITMENT TASK FOR ETHWORKS

To edit expressions edit variables located on
the top of the app.js file (variables named: "augend","addend")

```
let augend = " - 10x2 + 6x - 0.75";
let addend = " 3/2x + 12x0";
```

in expression each "+" or "-" must be
separated by a signle space from both sides

**_FOR EXAMPLE :_**

> augend = " - 10x2 + 6x - 0.75" **IS CORRECT**

> augend = "-10x2 +6x - 0.75" **IS INCORRECT**

exponent value must be located after an "x"
without any special characters or spaces

**_FOR EXAMPLE:_**

> augend = "5x2" **IS CORRECT**

> augend = "3x-2" **IS CORRECT**

> augend = "3x5/2" **IS CORRECT**

> augend = "2x0" **IS CORRECT**

> augend = "3x 2" **IS INCORRECT**
